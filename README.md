# Data Analysis for Life Sciences 
This repository contains the material for the course on Data Analysis for Life Sciences taught as a virtual class by Wolfgang Huber and Britta Velten at Heidelberg university in the summer semester 2020. The course is directly based on the material by Rafael Irizarry, Mike Love and further contributors that was assembled at their [webpage](https://rafalab.github.io/pages/harvardx.html).

## Literature
The course mainly follows the chapters the book *Data Analysis for Life Science* by Rafael Irizarry and Mike Love. A free pdf version can be obtained [here](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences). In the pdf version you will also find links to Rmd-Documents that were used to generate the book and can be used to directly re-run and experiment with the code.


## Course agenda
The course consists of 14 days, where each day covers parts of the book Data Analysis for Life Science, accompanied by YouTube lectures of the authors and exercises to be solved. Please click on the respective day to go to the material relevant for each day.

## Course Slack channel
All discussions, announcemnets and Q&A sessions of the course will be communicaed via a [Slack](https://slack.com) channel. This is also a place to discuss and exchange among participants. In case you are not yet in the Slack channel, please write an e-mail to Britta Velten `b.velten@dkfz-heidelberg.de`.

## Q&A Sessions
Q&A Sessions will take place via Zoom every Monday and Thursday at 10am (duration: 30min - 1 hour). Details will be announced via Slack. 

The first Q&A session on Monday May 18 will serve as an introduction to the course explaining:

- how to use the course material (book, lectures, scripts and git repository)
- how to hand in exercises
- how Q&A sessions will work
- how the Slack channel should be used
- the criteria for course evaluation

In the following Q&A sessions we will answer your questions on the course. Please post any questions in the  [#questions channel](https://dataanalysis4-xqg7747.slack.com/archives/C012RP3781H) in Slack and we will answer them directly or in the following Q&A session.

## Exercises and course evaluation
Every day contains one or multiple exercise sheets that cover the material of the day.
To pass the course, solutions to *at least one exercise sheet per day* should be handed in. For this, please upload the .Rmd file(s) and .html report(s) containing your solutions to a [personal slack conversation with Britta Velten](https://dataanalysis4-xqg7747.slack.com/archives/D012Q4UHDGV) by the evening of each day. How to generate the .html file and use RMarkdown (.Rmd) files will be explained on Day 1. 

The last day will not cover any new material but will give you time to work on a personal data analysis project. Details will be announced on the evening of Thursday June 4. This project should be handed in by Friday evening (June 5) as an .html report and will be graded.
