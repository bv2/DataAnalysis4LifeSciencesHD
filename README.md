# Data Analysis for Life Sciences 
This repository contains all material for the course on Data Analysis for Life Sciences taught as a virtual class by Wolfgang Huber and Britta Velten at Heidelberg university in the summer semester 2020. The course is directly based on the material by Rafael Irizarry, Mike Love and further contributors that was assembled at their [webpage](https://rafalab.github.io/pages/harvardx.html)

## Course agenda
The course consists of 14 days, where each day goes through parts of the Data Analysis for Life Science, accompanied by YouTube lectures of the authors and exercises to be solved. Please click on the respective day to go to the material relevant for each day.

* [Day 1 (18/05)](day1/) :  Getting started with R and GitHub and basic data wrangling
* [Day 2 (19/05)](day2/) : Probability theory I: Random variables, central limit theorem and t-tests 
* [Day 3 (20/05)](day3/) : Probability theory II: Inference

* [Day 12 (03/06)](day12/) : Clustering and Machine Learning II
* [Day 13 (04/06)](day13/) : Batch effects
* [Day 14 (05/06)](day14/) : Wrap-up and projects

## Literature
The course mainly follows the chapters the book Data Analysis for Life Science by Rafael Irizarry and Mike Love. A free pdf version can be obtained [here](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences). In the pdf version you will also find links to Rmd-Documents that were used to generate the book and can be used to directly re-run and experiment with the code.


## Q&A Sessions
Q&A Sessions will take place via Zoom every Monday and Thursday at 10am (duration: 30min - 1 hour). Details will be announced via Slack. 

The first Q&A session on Monday May 18 will serve as an introduction to the course explaining:

- how to use the course material (book, lectures, scripts and git repository)
- how to hand in exercises
- how Q&A sessions will work
- how the Slack channel should be used
- the criteria for course evaluation

## Course Slack channel
All discussions, announcemnet and Q&A sessions of the course will be communicaed via a [Slack](https://slack.com) channel. This is also a place to discuss and exchange among participants. In case you are not yet in the Slack channel, please write an e-mail to Britta Velten `b.velten@dkfz-heidelberg.de`.

## Exercises and course evaluation
Each day contains one or multiple exercise sheets that cover the material of the day.
To pass the course, solutions to *at least one exercise sheet per day* should be handed in. For this, please upload the .html reports containing your solutions to a personal slack conversation with Britta Velten. (The .html file can be generated using RMarkdown as explained on Day 1). Solutions of the exercises will be made available on the morning of following day. Hand-ins of exercises afterwards will no longer be accepted.

The last day will not cover any new material but give you time to work on a personal data analysis project (announced on the evening of Thursday June 4). This project should be handed in by Friday evening (June 5) as a html report and will be graded.
