# Data Analysis for Life Sciences 
This repository contains all material for the course on Data Analysis for Life Sciences taught as a virtual class by Wolfgang Huber and Britta Velten at Heidelberg university in the summer semester 2020. The course is directly based on the material by Rafael Irizarry, Mike Love and further contributors that was assembled at their [webpage](https://rafalab.github.io/pages/harvardx.html)


## Literature
The course mainly follows the chapters 1-9 of the book Data Analysis for Life Science by Rafael Irizarry and Mike Love. A free pdf version can be obtained [here](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences).

## Course agenda
The course consists of 15 days, where each day goes through parts of the Data Analysis for Life Science, accompanied by YouTube lectures of the authors and exercises to be solved. Please click on the respective day to go to the material relevant for each day.
