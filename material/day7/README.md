# Day 7

Today we will repeat some concepts from the last days.
For this go through the following exercise and hand them in by the end of today.
If parts are unclear, take your time to go back to the chapters in the book that covered this part.

## Optional advanced material on linear models

If you feel confident with the material of the last days you can look into a more advanced part of the book that  covers more advanced topics on linear models including how to model interactions in the model. Note that this is optional but useful to better understand the foundations of RNAseq analysis. If you are interested, you can follow these lectures and corresponding scripts from the book:
