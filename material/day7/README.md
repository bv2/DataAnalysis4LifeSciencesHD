# Day 7

Today we will repeat some concepts from the last days.
For this go through the following exercise:

## Exercises
Do the following exercise. If parts are unclear, take your time to go back to the chapters in the book that covered this part.

Wrap-up Exercise: [(html)](repetition_exercise.html) [(Rmd)](repetition_exercise.Rmd)

## Optional material on linear models

Alterntively, if you feel confident with the material of the last days you can look into a more advanced part of the book that  covers more advanced topics on linear models including how to model interactions in the model. Note that this is optional and will not be relevant for the remainder of the course. For this you can follow these lectures and corresponding scripts from the book:
