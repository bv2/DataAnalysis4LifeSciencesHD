Rmd with corrected Version of Q 7+8 of
[Population, Samples, and Estimates Exercises](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/populations_and_samples_exercises.html)


 For these exercises, we will be using the following dataset:
```{r}
library(downloader) 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/mice_pheno.csv"
filename <- basename(url)
download(url, destfile=filename)
dat <- read.csv(filename) 
```
 

We will remove the lines that contain missing values:
```{r}
dat <- na.omit( dat )
```
 
     
     
 
1.  Use `dplyr` to create a vector `x` with the body weight of all males on the control (`chow`) diet. What is this population’s average?
```{r}

```
    
 2.  Now use the `rafalib` package and use the `popsd` function to compute the population standard deviation.
     
```{r}

```
     
 3.  Set the seed at 2. Take a random sample X of size 25 from `x`. What is the sample average?
```{r}

```
     
4.   Use `dplyr` to create a vector `y` with the body weight of all males on the high fat (`hf`) diet. What is this population’s average?
     
5.   Now use the `rafalib` package and use the `popsd` function to compute the population standard deviation.
     
6.   Set the seed at 2. Take a random sample Y of size 25 from `y`. What is the sample average?
     
7.   What is the difference in absolute value between  $\bar{y} - \bar{x}$ and $\bar{Y}-\bar{X}$?
     
8.  Repeat the above for females. Make sure to set the seed to 2 before each `sample` call. What is the difference in absolute value between $\bar{y} - \bar{x}$ and $\bar{Y}-\bar{X}$?
     
9. For the females, our sample estimates were closer to the population difference than with males. What is a possible explanation for this?
     
     -   A) The population variance of the females is smaller than that of the males; thus, the sample variable has less variability.
     -   B) Statistical estimates are more precise for females.
     -   C) The sample size was larger for females.
     -   D) The sample size was smaller for females
