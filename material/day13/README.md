For this go through the following exercise and hand them in by the end of today.
If parts are unclear, take your time to go back to the chapters in the book that covered this part.

Wrap-up exercise:
TBD


## Optional advanced material on machine learning

If you feel confident with the material of the last days you can look into a more advanced part of the book that  covers more advanced topics onmachine learning. Note that this is optional. If you are interested, you can follow these lectures and corresponding scripts from the book:
