# Day 10

Today we will go more into details on analysing RNAseq data using the concepts of statistical modelling and testing that we have learnt in the previous days. For this we will move away from the book *Data Analysis for Life Sciences* for today and look into Chapter 8 of [*Modern Statistics for Modern Biology*](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/index.html). In the lab we will make use of the [Bioconductor package DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) to analyse the RNAseq data starting from count data.

Before starting with the exercises please go through Chapter 8 of Modern Statistics for Modern Biology and the accompanying lecture (Lecture 7: RNA-seq and linear models) provided along with the book [here](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/course_spring_2020/lectures.html) using the following links:

### Excercises

Today there are no extra exercises. The book chapter is very complex and important, so please take your time to go through everything carefully and experiment with the code. The exercises at the end of the book chapter are not relevant for this course. If you want, you can take a look at Exercise 8.1. If you feel you are confident with everything covered today you can already start working on the wrap-up exercise of [Day 13](../day13), which will also contain an RNA-seq example.
