# Day 1

Let's get started!
Today we will go through the first chapter of the book and get set up for the course.

For this you can follow these lectures and corresponding scripts from the book Data Analysis for Life Science:

- Getting Started with R [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8F_wreHTzw) [script](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/getting_started.html)
- GitHub [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSXwLm6txoo)
- RStudio [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgqxQFQf1qg)
- Using the Textbook [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WwYshzkfhA)
- Rstudio for Organization [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WmCLs3UUno)
- Introduction to dplyr [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeDMSyiqHc4) [script](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_intro.html)



## Exercises:

- [Getting Started](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/getting_started_exercises.html) [(Rmd)](ex_d1_getting_started.Rmd)
- [dpylr introduction](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_intro_exercises.html) [(Rmd)](ex_d1_dplyr.Rmd)

Note that in the second exercise (dplyr) the url pointing to the data is missing in the html version. This should be [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv) as specified in the Rmd.

You can download individual `.Rmd` files for the exercises from this folder (see above) or clone the full repository. Open them in RStudio and you will see that these consist of text and code chunks starting with ` ```{r}` . Code in these chunks can be evaluated like in a normal R script. Fill in the missing parts and then render the entire file to an `.html` file using the `Knit`-button at the top of the window displaying the file. You can also modify the text as well as header information of the markdown, e.g. set your name as author.
