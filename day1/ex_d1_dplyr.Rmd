 For these exercises, we will use a new dataset related to mammalian sleep. This data is described [here](http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/msleep.html). Download the CSV file from this location: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv).
 
 We are going to read in this data, then test your knowledge of they key `dplyr` functions `select` and `filter`. We are also going to review two different _classes_: data frames and vectors.
 
 1.  Read in the `msleep_ggplot2.csv` file with the function `read.csv` and use the function `class` to determine what type of object is returned.
```{r}
# to be filled
```
     
 2.  Now use the `filter` function to select only the primates. How many animals in the table are primates? Hint: the `nrow` function gives you the number of rows of a data frame or matrix.
```{r}
# to be filled
```

 3.  What is the class of the object you obtain after subsetting the table to only include primates?
```{r}
# to be filled
```

 4.  Now use the `select` function to extract the sleep (total) for the primates. What class is this object? Hint: use `%%` to pipe the results of the `filter` function to `select`.

```{r}
# to be filled
```

 5.  Now we want to calculate the average amount of sleep for primates (the average of the numbers computed above). One challenge is that the `mean` function requires a vector so, if we simply apply it to the output above, we get an error. Look at the help file for `unlist` and use it to compute the desired average.

```{r}
# to be filled
```

 6.  For the last exercise, we could also use the dplyr `summarize` function. We have not introduced this function, but you can read the help file and repeat exercise 5, this time using just `filter` and `summarize` to get the answer.
Here we will test some of the basics of R data manipulation which you should know or should have learned by following the tutorials above. You will need to have the file femaleMiceWeights.csv in your working directory. As we showed above, one way to do this is by using the downloader package:

```{r}
# to be filled
```
